## Adding your repository to the list

To add a new repository to the list, find the approrpiate section for the repository's language and add a new entry like this for GitHub-hosted repos:

```
* [username/repo]
```

or like this for non-GH repo

```
* [username/repo](https://not-github.com/username/repo)
```

Don't link to files or folder within the tree since that messes up the badges. Adding your own repos is perfectly fine. If you use multiple languages, than avoid adding your repo to more than 3 sections. Repositories not hosted on GitJuib are fine, but they won't have a "last commit" badge. The last commit times are automatically updated every hour. You don't need to make new PRs to update your entry.
